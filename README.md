# challenge-one
This was the first challenge of our Bootcamp. We were asked to refactor the CSS and HTML codes given to assure they were cleaned up and easier to read. 

## Steps Taken  
I cleaned the CSS by removing a lot of the repeated styles and combining where I could to make it smaller and cleaner. I also added notes to better explain the sections being styled in the CSS    

The HTML I replaced almost all of the 'div' tags with more semantic tags. I also removed a lot of the unnecessary id's and classes attached to some of the tags.
